# EXLskills Guided Projects Index

This is the repository for collaborating on EXLskills guided projects, for use with the [EXLskills Admin Tools](https://github.com/exlskills/adm-tools).

## Usage

Each file name is in the format of `guided_proejct_id.url.txt` and within each of those files is a URL that can be used with the [json form/export static html tool here](https://github.com/exlskills/adm-tools/blob/master/static-pages/gen-dd-json-export.html).

## Updating

To push updated material to the guided project page, make an update using the JSON export form admin tool, **click the convert button in the form**, and then update the URL in the corresponding `.url.txt` file in this repository.
